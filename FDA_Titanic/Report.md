## Observations & Guesses

1. Related attributes are interchangeable, such as ***Fare*** and ***Pclass***.

2. Attributes highly related to the label tend to end up on higher levels of the tree, perhaps it is due to the fact that they derive nodes with lower impurity.

3. Attibutes used at the bottom of the designed rules have less influence on the generation of the decision tree.
